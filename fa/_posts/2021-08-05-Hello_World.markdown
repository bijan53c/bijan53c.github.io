Hello world! This is my first post in this blog and cause I'm so tired right now and haven't found anything interesting yet , I'm posting this.
Let me tell you something. I'm using Jekyll for this blog and github page (in case you didn't notice the domain or it has been changed by me).
First I was so interested to use some nice themes (Right now I'm using default theme of jekyll) but after uploading a nice one (pushing to github) , I didn't feel good about it , cause it was not what I created , it was other people's code and you know ... . I decided to start showing off what actually I created and coded by my self not other's job (the theme was free anyway) , so default theme till I create my own jekyll theme , which may take lots of time to create.
But anyway , thanks for visiting my blog and my first post!
Good posts coming out soon!
