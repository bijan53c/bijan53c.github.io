Hello I'm Bijan and thanks for visiting my blog!
I'm a freelancer programmer and pentester. First I started my journey by creating and developing wordpress websites and blogs , meanwhile I got interested in creating computer and mobile games and after publishing some little games I found it boring , I started learning python and got interested in infosec and cyber security.
I got my CEH back in 2018 and that was where I found my self missing alot of things , so I started learning about web application security , and actually starting pentesting.
I hope my posts come usefull to everyone.
Thank you again and stay positive !
