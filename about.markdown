Hello I'm Bijan and thanks for visiting my blog!
I'm interested in computers and how stuff actually work , so I made this blog to post and share usefull things I see and learn.
I got my CEH back in 2019 and that was where I found my self missing alot of things , so I started learning about web application security , and actually starting pentesting.
And during all these times there were alot of people helping me out by blog posts and videos so I decided to give back to community and help others as much as I can. And I hope my posts come usefull to everyone.
Thank you again and stay positive !
