Hello this is Bijan , I'm a freelancer pentester and programmer.
  
  I started my journey by wordpress development and learning python in 2016, meanwhile I took a look in game development , I tried some game engines and created some games with and without help of friends and after publishing them , I figured out that is not my thing. After that I got interested more about the cyber security and infosec , so 
  I got my CEH in 2019 and that was where I found out this is just the beginning.
    
  I hope you like my blog posts and have a good day!
