Some time ago I faced a tutorial in the internet , named "SMSbomber" ; I had heard about it before but had no idea what kind of script exactly it is and what's supposed to do.

And cause I had spent my budget on buying online courses that mount , I was not going to pay any more for tutorials. Cause I also had bought tutorials from that website before ,
I knew there's a commenting system (not vulnerable) for that post (tutorial) and I could check comments before I buy the tutorial.(something normal :|  but usefull) .
So I checked the comments , then I figured out **What a stupid script kiddy thing** it is!

I'll tell you what it was but first let me tell you how I found out .

In comments people had asked about changing the text messages it would send to mobile phone numbers which was impossible with that script , and the creator of the 
script had answered to one of the questions **"It has 23(or something) api of different websites which will be used to send text messages to your target" **. So that was it!

### What this script was supposed to do :

User would enter a phone number , and the script would use some GET and POST methods on different websites like UBER or any website that would send SMS to your phone number (like sending links or activation number)
and there were not captcha on those fields. So the script would take the number you entered and automatically enter it on those websites for getting link or signing up or even newsletter or something
and after entering it would repeat the process for other websites again and again till it reaches the amount you wanted.

### So what's the benefit?

nothing special , your target would get surprised or anoyed or frightened if stupid enough , cause he or she is getting high amount of SMS's in a day.

### How you could make one ?
I'm not putting any kind of script out here , but let me tell you how (educational purpose : web task automation). Or better to count it as a tip maybe ; something like selenium and python would do the job for you or PHP.
