Hello people , I hope you are all ok. Today in this post , I wanna tell you about XSS. Ofcourse In this post I'm just trying to help you to get the main concept and 
it won't be in depth details , I will go to details later on other posts.

I'm trying to keep this post as short as possible , so it won't get complicated ; and cause of this you may need to know how web applications work and what is javascript.

OK , XSS is short form of cross site scripting , we use X at first cause , otherwise it will be CSS and CSS is used in front end stuff , and things could get messy.
When there is XSS vulnerability in a website , the attacker can run his own scripts on the victim web application , and this can lead to many many other attacks and hacks.
For example the easiest one is stealing cookies of other users, and this means that the attacker can hack users accounts and use them the way he wants , or steal their info or 
anything valuable in their account.
Usually this vulnerability is detected by trying to run javascript on the victim website.

### How websites stop hackers from doing XSS?
There are some ways to do that. Some common ways are :
- Input validation : which means controlling any field and data user gonna enter , so they won't enter js codes 
- using xss-protection header : this is somehow a must have , even some scanners find xss by checking if this header is not set
- using WAF's : WAF's(web application firewalls) are meant to defend websites from variouse type of attacks and one of the options they got is defending website from XSS.

### Can hackers still hack websites using XSS while above options are already set?
short answer : Yes.
Input validations can be bypassed if the programmer doesn't config them good. The header is more about the browser and by this header browser will avoid loading the content of XSS
and user will stay safe , but hackers can still attack using xss , this is not such a big problem. Firewalls are harder to bypassed again if they are configured good. And it depends 
on the firewall and it's structure , that how it can get bypassed.

But setting these stuff will make the websites more secure and decrease the chance of getting hacked. You know nothing is 100% secure and unhackable , anything has it's own
weak spots and vulnerabilities , so , we try to make everything more secure , cause there's always a bigger power that can defeat the security.
It's like a house and securing it with locks , doors and etc . But there's a chance that the thieves can still break in the house.

I think that will give you the main concept of XSS. And be aware that for keep learning. If you didn't get what I was saying maybe you need to learn how websites and javascript 
work.

I hope it has helped you , and thank you for reading this post.
