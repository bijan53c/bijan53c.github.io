Bash (bourne again shell) , is the programming language that is used in Linux and MacOS terminals. It means that every command you use in those terminals , is actually
a Bash command. *This is how I define it*

*How google says about this:*
> Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989,
>  it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions
